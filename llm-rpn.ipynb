['The best joke among the jokes is:\n\n"Why couldn\'t the bicycle stand up by itself? Because it was two tired!"\n\nThis joke is clever because it plays on the double meaning of the word "tired" - one meaning being physically exhausted, and the other being the two tires of a bicycle. The pun is unexpected']
